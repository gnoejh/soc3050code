Fast PWM, duty cycle, and driving a DC motor through an H-bridge.

Part of the SOC3050 ATmega128 course, 2026 AVR edition. Runs on the shared
SimulIDE 1.1.0-SR2 board at 16 MHz.

## Build and run

```
build.bat        produces Main.elf and Main.hex
simulate.bat     opens the shared board with this lesson's firmware loaded
```

In SimulIDE press **Play** to start the simulation.
