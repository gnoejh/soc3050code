## �🔧 Development Workflow

### Using VS Code (Recommended)
```
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → Choose:
├── "Build Current Project"      # Compile to .elf and .hex
├── "Build and Simulate"         # Test in SimulIDE
├── "Program Current Project"    # Upload to hardware
└── "Open Serial Monitor"        # Debug via UART
```

### Using Command Line

**Easy Batch Files (No PowerShell Issues):**
```bash
# Build and program projects
build.bat                            # Build current project (wrapper)
tools\batch\build-project.bat        # Build specific project  
tools\batch\program-project.bat      # Program microcontroller
tools\batch\simulate-project.bat     # Test in SimulIDE
tools\batch\build-all.bat            # Build all projects

# Environment verification
setup.bat                            # Quick setup check (wrapper)
tools\batch\simple-check.bat         # Quick environment check
tools\batch\setup-check.bat          # Full verification
```

**Advanced PowerShell (for power users):**
```powershell
# Use -ExecutionPolicy Bypass to avoid policy issues
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/cli/cli-build-project.ps1 -ProjectDir "projects/Port_Basic"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/cli/cli-program-project.ps1 -ProjectDir "projects/Port_Basic"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/cli/cli-build-simulide.ps1 -ProjectDir "projects/Port_Basic"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verify-environment.ps1
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy Issues
If you get "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled":

```bash
# Option 1: Use batch file (easiest)
setup.bat

# Option 2: Run with bypass flag
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verify-environment.ps1

# Option 3: Fix PowerShell policy
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File fix-powershell.ps1
```

### Environment Issues
```bash
# Verify everything is working (use bypass if needed)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verify-environment.ps1 -Verbose

# Check specific tools
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/setup/check-simulide-environment.ps1
```

### Build Problems
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./tools/cli/cli-build-project.ps1 -Clean

# Check memory usage
./tools/cli/cli-analyze-code.ps1
```

### Programming Issues
- Ensure correct COM port in tasks.json
- Check programmer type (arduino, usbasp, etc.)
- Verify hardware connections
