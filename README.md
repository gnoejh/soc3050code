# SOC3050 — Embedded Systems

A self-contained teaching framework. Every lesson ships with source, a lecture
deck and a simulator circuit, and the whole toolchain is vendored — clone the
repository and it works, with nothing to install.

Two editions live here. **`projects2026_avr/` (ATmega128) is finished and
frozen; `projects2026_arm/` (STM32) is the live one**, and it is what
<https://gnoejh.github.io/soc3050code/> publishes. The ARM edition is early:
four theory lessons plus lesson 04, the first that builds (with the vendored
`tools/arm-toolchain/`) and runs in the browser on Wokwi's Nucleo-C031C6. The
AVR tree is still the larger body of working lessons.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd soc3050code
code .
```

Then open any file under `projects2026_avr/01_Port_Basic/` and press
**Ctrl+Shift+B** to build, or run **Terminal → Run Task → Simulate Current
Project** to open it in the simulator.

From a terminal instead:

```
cd projects2026_avr\01_Port_Basic
build.bat        compiles Main.c to Main.hex
simulate.bat     opens the shared board in SimulIDE 1.1.0-SR2
```

In SimulIDE press **Play**. Where a lesson prints to the serial port, open the
**Serial Monitor** at **9600 baud, 8N1**.

To check the whole course still builds:

```
pwsh projects2026_avr\_build\verify-all.ps1
```

## Which lesson tree to use

There are three. They are independent; none imports from another.

| | `projects2026_arm/` | `projects2026_avr/` | `projects/` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chip | STM32C031 (Cortex-M0+) | ATmega128 | ATmega128 |
| Status | **live, being written** | finished, frozen | archived |
| Lessons | 4 (Part 0, theory only) | an introduction plus 24 | 53, with overlaps |
| Build | none yet — `arm-none-eabi-gcc` by hand | one shared engine | per-project scripts |
| Run it | Renode / Wokwi, local | SimulIDE **1.1.0-SR2** | SimulIDE 1.1.0-SR1 |
| Slides | all 4, **published online** | all 25, offline only | 34 of 53 |

**To teach or study a topic today, start in `projects2026_avr/`** — see
[its README](projects2026_avr/README.md) for the lesson list and the board map.
It is frozen, not abandoned: everything in it builds, simulates and is verified.

**`projects2026_arm/`** is where new work goes. Its Part 0 is four decks on the
programmer's model, the instruction set, the toolchain and concurrency, with no
`Main.c` yet on purpose — see [its README](projects2026_arm/README.md).

`projects/` is left in place because a lot of supporting material still points
at it, but it is not being maintained — see
[projects/ARCHIVED.md](projects/ARCHIVED.md).

## The lessons

**Lesson 00** is the first class: what an embedded processor is, how the
toolchain turns C into firmware, and how the ATmega128 is built. It is the one
lesson to read before touching anything else.

Then twenty-two, in teaching order:

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 Port Basic | 07 Timer1 CTC | 13 UART Basic | 19 EEPROM |
| 02 Button Debounce | 08 Input Capture | 14 UART Ring Buffer | 20 Sleep Modes |
| 03 Keypad Matrix | 09 PWM DC Motor | 15 SPI Master | 21 Watchdog |
| 04 Inline Assembly | 10 PWM Servo | 16 I2C RTC | 22 RTOS Scheduler |
| 05 External Interrupts | 11 ADC Basic | 17 Character LCD | |
| 06 Timer0 Overflow | 12 ADC Light Sensor | 18 GLCD Graphics | |

Each lesson folder holds `Main.c`, `config.h`, `Slide.md`, `README.md`,
`build.bat` and `simulate.bat`.

---

## Lecture slides

Every lesson has a `Slide.md`. To turn all 25 into presentable HTML decks:

```
python projects2026_avr\_build\build-slides.py
```

Open `projects2026_avr/_slides/index.html`. Arrow keys or space to move, `o`
for an overview grid, `p` to print or save as PDF. There is also a
**Build Slides (2026)** task in VS Code.

### On the web

**<https://gnoejh.github.io/soc3050code/>** publishes the **ARM edition**
(`projects2026_arm/`), for teaching from a machine that does not have this
repository on it.

The AVR decks above are **not** published. They were the site until
2026-09-14; they are still here and still open from `_slides/index.html` in a
clone, but nothing serves them on the web now, so their old root URLs 404.

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` re-renders the ARM decks from their `Slide.md`
sources and deploys on every push that touches a deck or the renderer, so the
published site never lags the lesson text. Nothing else in the repository is
published — the workflow checks out only `projects2026_arm/` and uploads only
the rendered `_slides/` directory.

The site carries the slides only. Building and simulating a lesson still needs
a clone, because the compiler and SimulIDE are vendored under `tools/`.

## What is included

```
projects2026_arm/     the live STM32 edition - Part 0 + lesson 04, owns the website
projects2026_avr/     the finished AVR edition: 25 lessons + the shared board
projects/             the archived 53-project edition
shared_libs/          _port, _adc, _uart, _timer, _glcd, _eeprom, _pwm, _interrupt
tools/avr-toolchain/  avr-gcc 15.1.0, avr-objcopy, avr-size, avrdude
tools/arm-toolchain/  arm-none-eabi-gcc 15.2.1 + gdb, pruned to 227 MB
tools/cmsis/          CMSIS 6 core headers + ST's STM32C0xx device headers
tools/simulide110sr2/ SimulIDE 1.1.0-SR2 — the simulator the AVR edition targets
tools/simulide/       SimulIDE 1.1.0-SR1 and 0.4.15, for the archived tree
tools/cli/            build, program and analysis scripts
docs/                 framework, hardware and SimulIDE documentation
python_projects/      a separate Python track — see PYTHON_PROJECTS_GUIDE.md
```

**Nothing needs installing to build, on either edition.** Both compilers are
vendored, and so is SimulIDE.

The one difference: the **AVR** edition also vendors its simulator, so it needs
no internet at all. The **ARM** edition's simulator is
[wokwi.com](https://wokwi.com) in a browser — free, no account, no licence, but
it is a web page rather than a file in this repository. Students build locally
and upload `Main.elf` to it.

## VS Code tasks

| Task | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Build Current Project** (Ctrl+Shift+B) | Builds the lesson containing the open file |
| **Simulate Current Project** | Builds if needed, then opens it in SimulIDE |
| **Verify All Lessons (2026)** | Builds all 25 and validates every `Main.hex` |
| **Build Slides (2026)** | Renders all `Slide.md` files into HTML decks |
| **Show Memory Usage** | `avr-size` for the lesson's `Main.elf` |
| **Clean Project** | Removes build output from the lesson folder |
| **Program Hardware** | Flashes the built hex via avrdude |

Build and Simulate work in **both** trees — the task looks at which folder the
open file is in and picks the matching build system.

---

## Hardware

The lessons are written against the shared simulator board, and the same pin
map applies to a physical ATmega128 lab board.

| Port | Used for |
|------|----------|
| **PORTA0–7** | KS0108 graphic LCD data bus |
| **PORTB0–7** | 8 LEDs, **active low**; also stepper coils and the SPI bus |
| **PORTD0, D1, D4–D7** | push buttons, pulled up |
| **PORTD2, D3** | RXD1 / TXD1 — serial, 9600 8N1 |
| **PORTE4–E7** | GLCD control lines, also INT4–INT7 |
| **PORTF0–F2** | ADC inputs — potentiometer and joystick axes |
| **PORTG1, G4** | GLCD control, slide switch |

**LEDs are active low**: the anode is on the 5 V rail and the cathode on the
pin, so driving a pin LOW lights its LED. **PORTC is not connected** on this
board.

For real hardware you also need an ATmega128 board, a programmer (Arduino as
ISP, USBasp or similar) and a USB-serial adapter for the console.

## Troubleshooting

**PowerShell refuses to run a script**

```
setup.bat                                              # easiest
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File fix-powershell.ps1
```

**Check the environment**

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verify-environment.ps1 -Verbose
```

**A lesson will not build** — run `pwsh projects2026_avr\_build\verify-all.ps1
-ShowWarnings` to see whether it is just that lesson or something shared.

**Nothing appears in the serial monitor** — check it is on 9600 baud, and that
the board's serial component is the one wired to PD2/PD3.

**The simulator will not start** — check that
`tools/simulide110sr2/SimulIDE_1.1.0-SR2_Win64/simulide.exe` is present. It is
committed to the repository, so a complete clone has it.
