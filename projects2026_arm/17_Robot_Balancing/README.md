# 17 — Robot Balancing: PID vs LQR

**Part 3, Applications — lesson 17.**
Target: ST Nucleo-C031C6 (STM32C031C6, Cortex-M0+ at 48 MHz, no FPU), app board.

A two-wheeled self-balancing robot simulated **inside the firmware**: a 1 kHz
world task integrates the full nonlinear equations of a wheeled inverted
pendulum driven by DC motors with back-EMF and a supply limit, and synthesises
the sensors a real robot has — gyro (noise, bias), accelerometer (noise,
fooled by the robot's own acceleration, mounted 1° crooked) and wheel encoder
(relative to the body, quantised). A 200 Hz control task sees **only** those
sensors through `control_step(const sensors_t*, actuators_t*)` and answers
with a voltage, by one of three controllers chosen live with the joystick
button: PID on tilt, cascaded PID, or LQR. The LQR gain is computed by
`host/lqr.py` — standard library Python that parses the same `params.h`,
linearises, discretises, iterates the Riccati equation and proves the result
stable. The OLED draws the robot from the side with a tilt strip chart; `$BAL`
frames go to lesson 08's `host.py`.

## Build and run

```
build.bat        # FLASH 23892 B / 32 KB, RAM 10144 B / 12 KB, zero warnings
simulate.bat     # paste diagram.json, upload Main.elf
host\run.bat     # or: bash host/run.sh  - exits 0, "all checks passed"
python ..\08_UART_And_Python_Host\host.py --file capture.txt --chart BAL,3,-30000,30000
```

Controls: joystick up/down drives (±0.4 m/s), **space** (SEL) cycles the
controller, **a** stands the robot up, **b** pushes it, the knob loads it
(0-0.6 kg at 20 cm). `$BAL` fields: ms, mode, true tilt (mdeg), estimated
tilt (mdeg), x (mm), speed (mm/s), motor mV, fallen, payload (g).

## Verified by execution — on the host

`host/run.sh` (MinGW-w64 gcc 15.2.0, Python 3.12, seed 12345, sensor noise on),
exit 0, `all checks passed`:

**lqr.py** — open-loop poles +7.04, 0, −5.68, −70.4 /s (falling: e-fold
every 142 ms). Q = diag(30, 2, 50, 0.5), R = 1, 5 ms: Riccati converged in
2729 iterations, **K = [−5.1239, −15.255, −21.262, −2.4627]**. Closed-loop
eigenvalues 0.99606, 0.97958, 0.95914, 0.66211 — **spectral radius 0.99606**
(power check 0.99655). Linear model from 6°: peak 2.23 V, settled in 2.10 s.
`--check control.c`: matches.

**sitl** — the nonlinear model, the firmware's own controller:

| controller | settle from 6° | peak V | largest push | 30 s, no command | payload through 0.1 N s | drive 0.3 m/s, 5 s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PID tilt | never | 7.40 | 0.62 N s | fell at 7.8 s, 3.3 m away | 0.16 kg | −1.71 m (backwards) |
| cascade | 1.70 s | 2.10 | 0.60 N s | −0.09 m | 1.88 kg | 1.72 m |
| **LQR** | 3.00 s | 1.80 | **0.78 N s** | −0.07 m | 1.36 kg | 1.72 m |

Tilt estimate error (complementary filter) 1.1–1.4° rms. Two identical runs
agree bit for bit. The OLED frame is drawn by `view.c` on the PC and printed
pixel for pixel (756 lit).

Also measured on the host for the slides and lab: `lqr.py --pid` eigenvalues
(tilt-only PD runs away; with I an 89 s swing; position always at 1); Q/R
variants (slide 19 — Q_θ = 500 beats the default on every test); the cascade
**falls** in the drive test if its lean clamp is ±0.10 rad; noise survivable to
×8, falls at ×16; alpha sweep (accelerometer-only falls at 0.2 s); a 0.20 N s
push wins at 1.8 V supply; LQR plus speed feed-forward covers exactly the
target's 1.41 m instead of 1.72 m.

**What the host cannot show:** anything about the Cortex-M0+ itself — CPU time
per step (slide 22 is an estimate, ~240 µs for the world step), stack
high-water marks, I²C timing — and anything about Wokwi.

## Status

Builds with **zero warnings** (FLASH 23 892 B, RAM 10 144 B). The host
verification passes and its numbers are quoted above and in the deck, each
labelled *measured on the host*.

**Not yet watched running in Wokwi.** When someone does, look first at:

1. **`stats`** — the world step's microseconds and the CPU share. If the world
   step is anywhere near 1000 µs the 1 kHz physics cannot keep time, and
   everything else in the lesson is off. Also the `world`/`control` stack
   high-water marks against their 160 words.
2. **The OLED**: does the robot stand under LQR with nobody touching it, and
   does `b` make it lean back and return to the caret? Does PID tilt (space,
   then `a`) roll backwards and fall after several seconds, as the host
   predicts?
3. **The display's I²C cost** while the 1 kHz world runs above it: does the
   10 Hz picture keep up, and do `$BAL` frames arrive every 100 ms with good
   checksums in `host.py`?
