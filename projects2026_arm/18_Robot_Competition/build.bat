REM
REM  world.c, referee.c, bots.c, student.c and scene.c are compiled because
REM  they sit in this folder; they are pure C, and host\league.c compiles the
REM  same files on a PC.  From _lib\: the kernel (os), the interrupt UART and
REM  frame checksum (uart, proto), retarget's C library stubs, and the app
REM  board: I2C + OLED, joystick/buttons/knob (pad, adc), buzzer (beep).
