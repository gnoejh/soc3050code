# 15 — Robot Line Follower

**Part 3, Applications — the first robot.**
Target: ST Nucleo-C031C6 (STM32C031C6, Cortex-M0+ at 48 MHz), the app board.

A line-following robot races laps of four taped tracks on the OLED — and the
robot exists only inside the firmware. A **world task** (priority 5, 200 Hz)
steps a differential-drive robot with motor lag, a friction-circle tyre
model, wheel encoders and a seven-sensor reflectance bar, and judges laps and
DNFs. A separate **control task** (priority 4, 100 Hz) sees only the sensors
and writes only two wheel speeds, through
`control_step(const sensors_t *, actuators_t *)` in `control.h` — the
Software-In-The-Loop shape lessons 13–18 share. The joystick drives in manual
mode, the knob sets the speed, every lap beeps and prints a checksummed
`$LAP` frame for a class leaderboard, and `host/sitl.c` races the same C on a
PC to measure everything this README quotes.

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| `Slide.md` | the lecture - 31 pages as rendered: the title, the two pin-map slides, then the numbered slides, each register block's one-page map before its details |
| `Lab.md` | the lab: nine parts, ~2 hours, a leaderboard, **nothing handed in** |
| `control.h` | **the contract**: `sensors_t`, `actuators_t`, `control_step()`, the tunable gains |
| `control.c` | **the student's file**: weighted-average line position, PID, corner slow-down, gap / overshoot / crossing handling |
| `world.c`, `world.h` | the robot and the judge: motors (τ 40 ms, 8 m/s²), friction circle (0.7 g), encoders, sensor synthesis with ambient and noise, laps, DNF |
| `track.c`, `track.h` | four tracks as turtle programs (OVAL, S-BENDS, HAIRPINS, FIGURE-8 with a crossing and a gap), built into ≤ 1 mm polylines |
| `view.c`, `view.h` | the OLED: track drawn once, robot as an XOR triangle, lap times, sensor bars |
| `Main.c` | five RTOS tasks, the shared-data rules, `$LINE`/`$LAP` telemetry, the shell, on-chip cycle counting |
| `build.bat` | `LIBS=retarget os uart proto i2c oled adc pad beep` |
| `simulate.bat`, `diagram.json`, `wokwi.toml` | the app board, unchanged from `_targets/app-board-diagram.json` |
| `host/sitl.c`, `host/run.bat`, `host/run.sh` | **the host test**: nine measured tables, exit 1 on failure; also `race` and `ascii` modes |
| `host/leaderboard.py` | ranks `$LAP` frames from students' serial captures, checksum-verified (standard library only) |
| `.gitignore` | keeps `host/sitl.exe` out of git |

## Build and run

```
build.bat        # FLASH 26920 B / 32 KB, RAM 9352 B / 12 KB, zero warnings
simulate.bat
host\run.bat     # the races, on the PC: PASS: 0 failure(s)
python ..\08_UART_And_Python_Host\host.py --file capture.txt --chart LINE,3,-400,400
python host\leaderboard.py captures\*.txt
```

Controls: menu — joystick up/down, **A** to choose. Race — **A** start / stop
(back to the line), **B** next track, **SEL** manual ↔ auto, knob = speed
(0–2000 mm/s). Shell: `kp ki kd df slow thr N`, `noise ambient fail N`,
`gains`, `stats`.

### Stacks

The first build used guessed stacks (256–384 words) and linked at **11 728 B
of RAM**, 95% of the chip. The stacks were then sized from
`arm-none-eabi-gcc -fstack-usage` for this lesson's and `_lib`'s code, plus
newlib-nano's printf frames read from the disassembly (`_svfprintf_r` /
`_vfprintf_r` 144 B, `_vsnprintf_r` 120 B, `_printf_i` 64 B). Deepest chains:
`ui` ≈ 680 B (`send_frame` → `vsnprintf`), `display` ≈ 670 B (`oled_printf`),
`world` ≈ 330 B (`world_reset` → `track_build`). Each got its chain, 64 B for
the exception and context-switch frames, and roughly a third spare:
world 160, control 160, ui 256, shell 224, display 256 words. **RAM 9 352 B.**
`stats` prints the real high-water marks; check them before shrinking.

## Verified by execution — on the host

`host\run.bat` (MinGW-w64 gcc 15.2, the same `world.c`, `track.c`,
`control.c`, `view.c` and `_lib/oled.c` with the I²C call stubbed) — **exit 0,
`PASS: 0 failure(s)`**. Default gains: kp 20, ki 0, kd 1.0, dfilt 0.5, slow
0.5, thr 300; sensor noise 15.

| Test | Result, measured on the host |
|---|---|
| 1. tracks close | all four: closure miss **0.00 mm**; 71 / 97 / 111 / 92 points; 4911 / 4638 / 7076 / 5634 mm |
| 2. default gains, knob 500 (1000 mm/s), 5 laps | OVAL **5.12 s** (lap 1 5.20), S-BENDS **5.07**, HAIRPINS **7.46**, FIGURE-8 **5.99**; max true error 2.1 / 4.8 / 3.6 / 3.1 mm; **no DNF** |
| 3. speed sweep, fastest knob that finishes 3 laps | OVAL 1000 (2.81 s), S-BENDS **775** (3.72 s), HAIRPINS **675** (6.03 s), FIGURE-8 1000 (3.29 s). Without corner slow-down: S-BENDS 675 (4.26 s), HAIRPINS 575 (6.68 s) |
| 4. P vs PD vs PID, S-BENDS knob 700 | P only kp 20: **12.56 s**, RMS 27.5 mm (weaves, slides); kp 10: 13.19 s; **PD 3.80 s, RMS 5.4 mm**; PID (ki 2) 3.76 s, RMS 7.0 mm |
| 5. noise vs D filter, S-BENDS knob 700 | noise 80: chatter **602** mm/s unfiltered, 256 at dfilt 0.5, 162 at 0.25 — but RMS error 8.5 mm at 0.25 vs 5.7 at 0.5; lap times within 40 ms |
| 6. dead sensor, knob 500 | edge sensor: no effect; centre sensor: OVAL 6.48 s (vs 5.12), S-BENDS 6.07 s |
| (race mode) ambient 400 | HAIRPINS **DNF** at thr 300; **7.46 s** at thr 650 |
| 7. determinism | FIGURE-8 raced twice: identical results |
| 8. OLED | frame drawn by `view.c` printed as text (slide 22) |
| 9. shortcuts | box test leaves 2.8–3.7 segments per step on average (max 6) of 70–110; OLED **448–501 bytes per 10 Hz frame** vs 1032 for a full repaint |

## Status

- **Builds with zero warnings**: FLASH 26 920 B, RAM 9 352 B.
- **Host test passes** with the numbers above.
- **Not yet watched running in Wokwi.** Nothing on the chip side — timing,
  the display, the buttons, the beeps — has been seen. The first three things
  to look at when someone does:
  1. **`stats`, the world step's cycles.** It must fit well inside 240 000
     (5 ms at 48 MHz) or world time falls behind real time and every lap
     time differs from the host's. This is the lesson's biggest unmeasured
     assumption: ~3 exact distance checks × 7 sensors plus the judge's 11, in
     soft float, per step.
  2. **Does OVAL at the default knob lap in about 5.1 s** (Lab Part 0)? Close
     agreement with the host says the SITL chain holds on the chip; a
     difference of seconds says the world task is late.
  3. **The menu and the joystick direction.** `pad.c` flips HORZ; the menu
     uses VERT (up = previous track). If up moves the cursor down, or manual
     steering is mirrored, that is a sign error in this lesson, not in Wokwi.
