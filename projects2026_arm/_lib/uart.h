/*
 * uart.h - shared copy of lesson 08's interrupt-driven USART2.  LIBS=uart os
 *
 * Receive:  the USART2 interrupt puts each byte into a kernel queue, and a
 *           task blocks on it with uart_getc() - using no CPU until a byte
 *           arrives.
 * Transmit: printf() -> _write() -> a lock-free ring buffer -> the TXE
 *           interrupt feeds the UART one byte at a time.  printf() returns
 *           as soon as the text is in the ring, not when it has been sent.
