/*
 * keys.h - turning terminal bytes back into keys   (lesson 08)
 *
 * A terminal sends a letter as one byte, but an arrow key as THREE:
 *
 *   Up  ESC [ A     Down  ESC [ B     Right  ESC [ C     Left  ESC [ D
 *
 * (ESC is 0x1B.  Some terminals send ESC O A instead; both are accepted.)
 * So a key is a tiny protocol, framed like lesson 08's $...*CS lines: a start
 * byte, a body, and a final byte that says "done".  This decoder is the
 * state machine that finds those frames in the byte stream.
 *
 * The Esc key alone is the hard case: it is the same byte that STARTS every
 * sequence.  The only way to tell them apart is time - a real sequence arrives
 * all at once, a person pressing Esc is followed by silence.  key_timeout()
 * makes that call.
 *
 * Pure C, no hardware: the same file would compile on a PC - and does, to
 * test it.
