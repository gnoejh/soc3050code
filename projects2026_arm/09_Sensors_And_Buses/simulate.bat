REM
REM  ALWAYS rebuilds first.  The AVR edition shipped a simulate.bat that only
REM  built when Main.hex was missing, so every fix after the first build was
REM  invisible and people debugged firmware they had already replaced.
REM  See CLAUDE.md section 9e.  Do not "optimise" this back.

echo   2. In the Wokwi tab open its "diagram.json" tab, select all,
echo      and paste in the Notepad text: a potentiometer (PA4), an
echo      MPU6050 (I2C, PB8/PB9) and a MAX7219 8x8 matrix (SPI,
echo      PA5/PA7, CS PB0).  This lesson needs all three.
