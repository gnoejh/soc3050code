/*
 * i2c.c - I2C1 master, polled   (SOC3050 lesson 09)
 *
 * Two wires, many devices, one address byte each.  The STM32C0's I2C block
 * does the bit-level work - start, address, acknowledge, stop - and the
 * software loads CR2 with WHAT to do (address, direction, byte count) and then
 * feeds or drains one byte at a time as ISR asks:
 *
 *   TXIS   ready for the next byte to send       -> write TXDR
 *   RXNE   a byte has arrived                     -> read RXDR
 *   TC     all NBYTES done, no STOP yet (AUTOEND=0) - time for a repeated START
 *   STOPF  a STOP went out: the transaction is over
 *   NACKF  the device did not acknowledge - it is absent, or busy, or refused
 *
 * Nothing can wait forever.  A device that is missing answers with NACK; a bus
 * that is stuck answers with nothing at all, and only a timeout ends that.
